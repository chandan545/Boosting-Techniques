# Boosting-Techniques
Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong learner with improved predictive performance. It works sequentially, where each new model focuses on correcting the errors made by previous models. Over time, the combined model becomes more accurate.
